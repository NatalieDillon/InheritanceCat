# Inheritance in C# with Cats

## Instructions

All the tests in the solution are broken.

To fix them you must appropriately use an C# abstract class with sub classes

The objects you'll be working with are all types of Cat

By definition the blueprint for ALL cats is that they can do the following things:

    * Eat
    * Sleep

They ALL have the following attributes:

    * A piece of data that says whether they are asleep or not 
    * An average height represented in centimetres
    * A piece of data that indicates their setting such as "domestic" or "wild"
    * ALL cats go to sleep exactly the same way. 

After a cat has eaten its food their reaction tends to differ between species:

    * A Lion will let out a roar
    * A cheetah will let out a snoring sound as it becomes tired following a chase
    * A domestic cat tends to lets out a purring sound

There is an empty Cat abstract class. 
Your first task is to figure out what should be put in the abstract class.
